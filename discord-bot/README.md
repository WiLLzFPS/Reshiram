# Discord Bot

This project is a simple Discord bot built using the discord.py library. The bot connects to Discord and has basic functionality to respond to events.

## Project Structure

```
discord-bot
├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Main logic for the Discord bot
│   └── config
│       └── token.py     # Holds the bot token (not committed to version control)
├── .gitignore           # Specifies files to be ignored by Git
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd discord-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install discord.py
   ```

3. **Create the token file:**
   In `src/config/token.py`, define your bot token:
   ```python
   TOKEN = 'your-bot-token-here'
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   Execute the main script:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will connect to your Discord server and be ready to respond to events. Make sure to invite the bot to your server using the appropriate OAuth2 URL.

## Important

Ensure that `src/config/token.py` is included in your `.gitignore` file to keep your bot token secure and prevent it from being exposed in version control.
